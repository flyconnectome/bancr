\usage{
banc_codex_annotations(rootids = NULL, live = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{rootids}{Character vector specifying one or more BANC rootids. As a
convenience this argument is passed to \code{\link{banc_ids}} allowing you
to pass in data.frames, BANC URLs or simple ids.}

\item{live}{logical, get the most recent data or pull from the latest materialisation}

\item{...}{method passed to \code{\link{banc_cave_query}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} describing that should be similar to what you find for BANC
in FlyWireCodex.
}
\description{
Provides access to centralised cell type annotations from the BANC core team,
which are the official annotations available on FlyWireCodex. These standardised
annotations ensure consistency across the dataset and serve as the authoritative
cell type classifications for the BANC connectome.
}
\details{
This function accesses centralised cell type annotations curated by the BANC core
team, in contrast to \code{\link{banc_cell_info}} which contains non-centralised
annotations from the broader research community. The centralised annotations provide
standardised cell type classifications that are displayed on FlyWireCodex and serve
as the official reference for BANC cell types.
